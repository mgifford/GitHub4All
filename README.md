# GitHub4All
A public space for accessibility issues with GitHub, not managed by GitHub. 

GitHub is great! It has become a part of the infrastructure of progress. Yet many people with disabilities are not able, or have an incredibly frustrating time, to be part of this amazing community. This isn't because of a technical limitation, but is rather due to the various accessibility issues that make the usage of GitHub a frustrating experience for colaborators that use assistive technologies.

## What Can We Do About It?

### Add and Log Issues
Add accessibility issues to the issues associated with this project and then email support@github.com about them.

GitHub needs an issue queue of it's own to manage accessibility problems as they inevitably come up. Having an responsive person at the end of a support email is great, but as every GitHub project owner knows, there's a lot more power to a threaded issue queue than there is to email support.

#### A GitHub issue queue allows:
1. everyone to see the issues that have been posted to check to see if someone has already reported it.
2. a transparent space to see how long it takes issues to be addressed, thus giving users confidence that accessibility issues have priority. 
3. interested parties to review "bugs" and offer suggestions.

We'd like GitHub to have a team of accessibility experts to resolve these issues, but even better, we want GitHub to leverage a community of users who already have expertise in this area and use GitHub itself to make GitHub more inclusive for everyone.
